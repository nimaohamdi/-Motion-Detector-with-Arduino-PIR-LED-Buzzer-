# Motion Detector with Arduino (PIR + LED + Buzzer)

This project uses an Arduino board with a PIR motion sensor to detect movement. When motion is detected, an LED lights up and a buzzer sounds. It's ideal for simple security systems or motion-based notifications.

## üß∞ Components Used
- Arduino UNO (or compatible board with CH340 chip)
- PIR Motion Sensor
- LED
- Buzzer
- Jumper Wires
- Breadboard
